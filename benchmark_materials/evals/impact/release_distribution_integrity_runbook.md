# Release Distribution Integrity Runbook

This document describes how to reproduce the current `release_distribution_integrity` manual
impact eval and how the generated repos differ before any prompt is run.

For result chronology and synthesis, read:

- `evals/impact/notes/index.md`
- `evals/impact/notes/manual_v2_original_10_repo_findings.md`
- `evals/impact/report.md`

## Goal

Measure whether AI wiki memory changes how reliably an agent keeps a public release/distribution
matrix aligned across the relevant code, workflow, packaging, documentation, and verification
surfaces.

The intended good outcome is:

- public release targets added in the main workflow
- npm target resolution and package metadata kept in sync with those targets
- Windows archive-format differences handled correctly
- release and install docs updated to match the public matrix
- release-facing checks extended enough to catch obvious target drift

## Historical Trigger

This benchmark is backsolved from repeated real release/distribution failures in this repo, not a
synthetic "matrix coordination" toy task.

The combined historical problem shape was:

- Windows npm support looked partly declared but was not fully real end to end
- later target expansion added `linux-arm64`, `linux-musl-x64`, and `windows-arm64`
- release workflow, npm metadata, archive handling, docs, and verification could drift apart

The benchmark-targeted memory cluster is:

- raw draft:
  - `ai-wiki/people/bochengyin/drafts/distribution-target-matrix-must-match-published-assets.md`
- promoted convention:
  - `ai-wiki/conventions/distribution-target-matrix-must-match-published-assets.md`

## Baseline

All variants are generated from the historical git ref:

- `06a47cd^`

That baseline predates the later coordinated expansion work, so the experiment does not start from
repos that already advertise the full intended target matrix.

## Generation Script

Workspace generation is defined in:

- `evals/impact/scripts/prepare_variants.py`

Important defaults:

- source mode: committed git snapshot, not the current working tree
- experiment family: `release_distribution_integrity`
- baseline ref: `06a47cd^`

This keeps local uncommitted notes, eval scaffolding, and scratch work out of the generated
experiment repos.

## Variant Setup

All variants start from the same historical baseline. The intended differences are the AI wiki
surface and which benchmark-targeted memory files are present.

### plain_repo_no_aiwiki

Removed:

- `ai-wiki/`
- repo-shared managed AI wiki block from `AGENTS.md`
- `.agents/skills/ai-wiki-*`

Meaning:

- no AI wiki scaffold
- no AI wiki prompts
- no AI wiki skills

### aiwiki_no_relevant_memory

Keeps the AI wiki scaffold, but removes the benchmark-targeted distribution-matrix memory.

Removed raw draft:

- `ai-wiki/people/bochengyin/drafts/distribution-target-matrix-must-match-published-assets.md`

Removed consolidated doc:

- `ai-wiki/conventions/distribution-target-matrix-must-match-published-assets.md`

Removed index entry:

- `ai-wiki/conventions/index.md` entry for `distribution-target-matrix-must-match-published-assets.md`

Important:

- this family removes the directly targeted matrix-memory files only
- other adjacent release docs still remain in the repo
- so `aiwiki_no_relevant_memory` is "targeted-memory removed", not "memory-free release repo"

### aiwiki_scaffold_no_adjacent_memory

This is the sixth default diagnostic for Manual v2 neutral slots.

Start from the realistic AI wiki workflow scaffold, then remove:

- the benchmark-targeted distribution-matrix raw draft and promoted convention
- the direct convention index entry
- adjacent release/problem memories that explained the clean-run `s02` success:
  - `ai-wiki/problems/linux-musl-pyinstaller-needs-binutils-objdump.md`
  - `ai-wiki/problems/windows-arm-smoke-version-checks-need-full-cli-output.md`
  - `ai-wiki/people/bochengyin/drafts/introducing-new-npm-package-names-needs-a-bootstrap-publish-plan.md`
  - `ai-wiki/people/bochengyin/drafts/linux-release-binaries-need-runtime-checks-against-an-older-glibc-baseline.md`
  - `ai-wiki/trails/2026-04-18-release-workflow-and-prompt-block-edge-cases.md`

Purpose:

- distinguish "AI wiki scaffold and workflow path" from "AI wiki plus adjacent release memory"
- test whether the previous `aiwiki_scaffold_no_target_memory` success was carried by nearby release
  memories rather than the scaffold alone

### aiwiki_raw_drafts

Starts from `aiwiki_no_relevant_memory`, then adds back only the raw draft:

- `ai-wiki/people/bochengyin/drafts/distribution-target-matrix-must-match-published-assets.md`

No promoted shared convention is added back.

### aiwiki_consolidated

Starts from `aiwiki_no_relevant_memory`, then adds back only the promoted shared convention:

- `ai-wiki/conventions/distribution-target-matrix-must-match-published-assets.md`

And re-adds its index entry:

- `ai-wiki/conventions/index.md`

### aiwiki_raw_plus_consolidated

Includes both:

- the raw draft
- the promoted shared convention
- the restored convention index entry

## Active Prompt

Prompt family:

- `evals/impact/prompts/release_distribution_integrity/`

Task description:

- `evals/impact/prompts/release_distribution_integrity/TASK.md`

Formal v2 runs use one active prompt level:

- `original.md`

`original.md` recreates the historical distribution request without directly listing every coupled
surface that should change. That makes the run test whether memory/workflow helps the agent
coordinate the release matrix instead of simply following an answer-like prompt.

Legacy round1 prompts remain only for old-run interpretation:

- `short.md`
- `medium.md`

Do not use `medium.md` for workflow-primary claims; it tells the agent the coordination answer too
directly.

## Codex CLI-First Protocol

For each neutral slot:

1. Prefer `run_cli_slots.py` so the whole slot set runs under one `caffeinate -dimsu` sleep guard.
2. Run `original.md` with `codex exec` from a fresh persisted CLI session.
3. Use the same `gpt-5.5` / `xhigh` condition across all slots.
4. Capture the workspace with:
   - `evals/impact/scripts/save_result.py`
5. Export the visible Codex sessions with:
   - `evals/impact/scripts/export_codex_sessions.py`
6. Validate the run with:
   - `evals/impact/scripts/validate_run.py`
7. Grade the run from:
   - `workspace_diff.patch`
   - `workspace_diff_stat.txt`
   - `visible_transcript.md`
   - `visible_session.jsonl`
   - the changed tests

Important controls:

- one fresh session per slot
- same selected model and reasoning effort across variants
- same prompt text within a comparison set
- save artifacts outside the experiment repos
- do not grade from `report.md` or `final_message.md` alone
- require a complete `codex_sessions/manifest.json` before making shareable claims
- require exported session metadata to show `source=exec`, `model=gpt-5.5`, and
  `reasoning_effort=xhigh`

Computer Use or the VS Code Codex extension can still be used for smoke checks, but UI automation
is not the formal execution path.

Whole-run command:

```bash
uv run python evals/impact/scripts/run_cli_slots.py \
  --run-dir <run-dir> \
  --prompt-level original
```

`run_cli_slots.py` includes `s01` through `s06` by default because `init_run.py` reads
`assignment.json`.

If the sleep guard is unavailable or a `codex exec` process hangs before writing
`final_message.md`, treat that run as an infrastructure confound and restart from a new workspace
for formal claims.

## Artifact Interpretation Rules

The current harness captures useful artifacts, but the analysis should follow these rules:

1. Treat `prompt.md` as the task prompt only.
2. Treat `visible_transcript.md` and `visible_session.jsonl` as the visible full prompt surface.
3. Use `workspace_diff.patch` plus the session trace to judge whether the implementation really hit
   the task.
4. Treat `final_message.md` as optional convenience output, not the source of truth.
5. If a session continued after the first substantive closeout, use the first closeout block in
   `visible_transcript.md` rather than a later `final_message.md` snapshot.

## Model And Sampling Notes

The formal v2 condition is:

- execution surface: `codex-cli`
- model family: `gpt-5.5`
- reasoning effort: `xhigh`

`init_run.py` records those expected fields in `metadata.json`. `export_codex_sessions.py` exports
the observed session `source`, model, and reasoning effort into each session `metadata.json` and
the workspace-level `manifest.json`. `validate_run.py` treats mismatches as critical confounds.

The legacy saved release run was executed manually with GPT-5.4 at extra-high reasoning through
subscription sessions. Use it as historical qualitative evidence, not as the formal v2 condition.

No temperature or seed is captured here.

## Manual Scoring Rubric

Use this rubric when assigning a post-run label.

### Success

All of the following are true:

- the run makes Windows npm support real end to end
- the public release workflow matrix and npm target/package metadata are aligned
- Windows archive handling is updated where needed
- the main release/install docs are updated
- the run adds or updates enough release-facing checks to cover the widened matrix
- no obvious target drift remains in a major coupled surface

### Partial

The run gets the main expansion mostly right but still leaves a notable coupled-surface gap, for
example:

- the main workflow and npm path are aligned, but another relevant public distribution surface is
  left behind
- docs are updated, but release-facing verification remains thinner than the change warrants
- the implementation broadly works, but one important coupled layer would likely need review before
  treating the matrix as fully aligned

### Fail

Any of the following is enough for failure:

- only one layer is updated
- Windows npm support is still not real end to end
- the public matrix still obviously drifts across workflow, packaging, docs, or verification
- the run advertises support that the repo still does not actually publish or stage correctly

## Current Saved Runs

### Manual v2 original transition run

- workspace root:
  - `/private/tmp/aiwiki_first_round/release_distribution_integrity/workspaces/20260425-005106`
- run dir:
  - `/private/tmp/aiwiki_first_round/release_distribution_integrity/runs/ui-original-five-slots-20260425-0218`
- exported sessions:
  - `/private/tmp/aiwiki_first_round/release_distribution_integrity/workspaces/20260425-005106/codex_sessions_ui_original_release/manifest.json`
- findings note:
  - `evals/impact/notes/manual_v2_original_10_repo_findings.md`

Important: this was a transition run. `s01` used VS Code Codex UI, while `s02` through `s05` used
Codex CLI fallback after Computer Use / VS Code accessibility became unreliable. Use it as
qualitative evidence, not a clean formal causal run.
