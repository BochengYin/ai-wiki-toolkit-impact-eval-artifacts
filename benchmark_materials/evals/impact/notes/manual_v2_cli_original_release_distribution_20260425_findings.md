# Manual v2 CLI Original Release Distribution Findings

This note records the clean formal `release_distribution_integrity` run from 2026-04-25, plus the
supplemental `s06` diagnostic added later the same day.

It used Codex CLI-first execution for every slot, persisted one independent session per slot, and
validated the exported session manifest before scoring.

## Scope

Run label:

- `cli-original-release-20260425-1246`

Prompt/model condition:

- prompt: `evals/impact/prompts/release_distribution_integrity/original.md`
- model: `gpt-5.5`
- reasoning effort: `xhigh`
- execution surface: `codex-cli`

Run artifacts:

- workspace root: `/private/tmp/aiwiki_first_round/release_distribution_integrity/workspaces/20260425-124642`
- run dir: `/private/tmp/aiwiki_first_round/release_distribution_integrity/runs/cli-original-release-20260425-1246`
- session export: `/private/tmp/aiwiki_first_round/release_distribution_integrity/workspaces/20260425-124642/codex_sessions`
- generated report: `/private/tmp/aiwiki_first_round/release_distribution_integrity/runs/cli-original-release-20260425-1246/report.md`

The run used `evals/impact/scripts/run_cli_slots.py`, which wrapped the full five-slot sequence in
`/usr/bin/caffeinate -dimsu`. `sleep_guard.json` shows the guard was enabled from
`2026-04-25T12:46:59` to `2026-04-25T13:54:47`.

After the original five-slot run had already been scored, a supplemental `s06`
`aiwiki_scaffold_no_adjacent_memory` repo was added inside the same workspace/run folder and executed
with the same original prompt, model, reasoning effort, and Codex CLI-first path. The original
`s01` through `s05` results were not rerun.

## Validation

`export_codex_sessions.py` now exports six sessions, one for each neutral slot. The session manifest
records:

- `source=exec`
- `model=gpt-5.5`
- `reasoning_effort=xhigh`
- one distinct session id for each of `s01` through `s06`

After export, `validate_run.py` reported:

- `shareable_for_causal_claims: true`
- `critical_confounds: []`
- `warnings: []`

All six `codex exec` processes returned 0, all six `save_result.py` captures returned 0, and all
six slots produced `final_message.md`.

## Slot Scores

| slot | variant | role | score | key evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `s01` | `no_aiwiki_workflow` | primary control | partial | Broadly expanded the matrix, npm metadata, Windows zip staging, docs, Homebrew, and tests, but left `linux-musl-x64` on `python:3.11-alpine` without binutils/objdump setup or root setup. |
| `s02` | `aiwiki_scaffold_no_target_memory` | diagnostic | success | Added the full public matrix, zip staging, npm libc metadata/runtime selection, docs, Homebrew, tests, and Alpine musl binutils setup under root. |
| `s03` | `aiwiki_linked_raw_only` | diagnostic | success | Used raw release-memory surface and coordinated workflow, npm, docs, tests, Windows zip staging, and musl root/setup handling. |
| `s04` | `aiwiki_linked_consolidated_only` | diagnostic | success | Used consolidated release-memory surface and coordinated workflow, npm, docs, tests, Windows zip staging, and musl root/setup handling. |
| `s05` | `aiwiki_ambient_memory_workflow` | primary treatment | success | Aligned all major coupled surfaces and explicitly handled the known Alpine musl binutils/root setup hazard plus npm libc target resolution. |
| `s06` | `aiwiki_scaffold_no_adjacent_memory` | diagnostic | success | Without adjacent release/task memory, still aligned the workflow matrix, npm targets/libc selection, Windows zip staging, docs, Homebrew, and release-facing checks. |

The manual scores were written with `evals/impact/scripts/score_run.py` and the aggregate report was
generated with `evals/impact/scripts/report_runs.py`.

## Primary Comparison

The primary comparison is `no_aiwiki_workflow` versus `aiwiki_ambient_memory_workflow`.

Result:

- `no_aiwiki_workflow`: partial
- `aiwiki_ambient_memory_workflow`: success

The no-AI-wiki slot was strong enough to attempt the broad expansion. It updated the release
workflow, npm target map, runtime wrapper, Windows archive staging, docs, Homebrew, and tests.

The important miss was release-build integrity for the new musl target. It selected
`python:3.11-alpine` and a POSIX shell for `linux-musl-x64`, but did not install `binutils`/`objdump`
or run that setup as root. That leaves a likely PyInstaller musl build failure in a central
release-facing path, so the run is not a full rubric success.

The ambient AI wiki slot produced a similarly broad expansion, but also applied the known musl
release lesson. It added target-specific container setup, installed `binutils` before the PyInstaller
build, ran that setup as root, added runtime checks, and kept npm `libc` metadata and musl runtime
selection aligned with the public matrix.

Interpretation: this formal run supports a narrower but useful AI wiki claim for release
distribution work. AI wiki memory was not needed for the agent to notice the broad matrix expansion,
but it did help avoid a known cross-surface release hazard that the no-AI-wiki primary control
missed.

## Diagnostic Variants

Diagnostics explain possible mechanisms but are not the primary conclusion.

`aiwiki_scaffold_no_target_memory` succeeded. This shows that scaffold, adjacent memory, web docs, and
model reasoning can also be enough for this task. It should not be read as a pure absence-of-memory
condition because this family intentionally removes only the directly targeted distribution-matrix
memory, not all adjacent release memory.

`aiwiki_linked_raw_only` succeeded. It supports the explanation that raw release-memory notes can
carry enough concrete detail to close the musl, npm, and Windows archive surfaces.

`aiwiki_linked_consolidated_only` also succeeded. In this run, the promoted distribution convention
plus adjacent problem memory were enough to produce a complete coordinated implementation.

`aiwiki_scaffold_no_adjacent_memory` also succeeded. This strict scaffold diagnostic removed the
targeted distribution memories and adjacent release-fix drafts, yet still completed the matrix
alignment. Its transcript shows external official/current reference checks for runner labels, npm
`libc` metadata, and PyInstaller platform support. That weakens any claim that release-distribution
success required task-specific AI wiki memory. The primary comparison remains `s01` versus `s05`,
where the no-AI-wiki control was partial and the ambient workflow was success, but `s06` shows that
generic scaffold/workflow context plus model reasoning and current docs can be enough on this family.

## Non-Critical Observations

- `s02` needed an npm cache workaround for `npm pack`; the command passed after using a local cache.
- Some AI wiki variants wrote draft notes inside their slot repos. Those are expected behavior for
  the AI wiki workflow variants and are captured as artifacts, not repo changes.
- Several slots consulted current GitHub and npm documentation for runner labels and package
  metadata. That makes the run realistic, but it is still a time-varying external input.
- The supplemental `s06` slot explicitly reported reference checks against current GitHub, npm, and
  PyInstaller docs; this is relevant when interpreting why it succeeded without adjacent memory.

None of these were reported by `validate_run.py` as critical confounds.

## Validity Threats

Remaining threats:

- This is one sample per condition, not a seed-controlled estimate.
- The benchmark is backsolved from real prior release issues, so the treatment memory is unusually
  well matched to the task.
- No actual GitHub Actions release was executed; success is inferred from diff review, changed tests,
  workflow parsing, and local verification commands.
- Manual scoring was rubric-based and artifact-backed, but still human judgment.
- Slots ran sequentially, so time/order effects are not ruled out.
- The `s06` strict no-adjacent diagnostic was added after the original five slots rather than as part
  of the initial sequential batch, so it is explanatory rather than part of the primary comparison.
- External GitHub/npm docs were available to all variants and can mask some memory benefit.
- `temperature` and seed are not captured.

Controls that improved over the transition run:

- neutral slot paths
- one independent persisted CLI session per slot
- original prompt only
- no VS Code UI or Computer Use formal execution path
- run-level `caffeinate` protection
- complete exported session manifest with observed source/model/effort
- clean validator output after export

## Bottom Line

For the formal release-distribution primary comparison, this run directionally supports a narrow
"AI wiki working mode is useful" claim: the no-AI-wiki slot did a broad partial implementation but
missed a known musl release-build hazard, while the realistic AI wiki slot completed that hazard
along with the rest of the release/npm distribution matrix.

The supplemental `s06` success keeps that claim narrow. It shows that this task family can also be
solved without adjacent task memory, so release-distribution is better evidence for AI wiki improving
coordination quality than for AI wiki being necessary for success.

The diagnostic variants are useful for mechanism analysis, but they should not be promoted into the
main causal conclusion.
